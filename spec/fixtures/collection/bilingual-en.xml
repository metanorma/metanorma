<p id="_473d48f3-3a16-be9b-250f-5151e554b54f">In 1977, recognizing the lack of international consensus on the expression of uncertainty in measurement, the world’s highest authority in metrology, the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM), requested the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) to address the problem in conjunction with the national standards laboratories and to make a recommendation.</p>

<p id="_f5f104e6-2a65-ee97-c346-fabf5a9c822b">The BIPM<index><primary>BIPM</primary></index> prepared a detailed questionnaire covering the issues involved and distributed it to 32 national metrology laboratories known to have an interest in the subject (and, for information, to five international organizations). By early 1979 responses were received from 21 laboratories <eref type="inline" bibitemid="CIPM1980" citeas="[1]"/>

<p id="_bc972109-5117-8f5c-c260-0d7389f93aef">In producing this 2008 version of the GUM, necessary corrections only to the printed 1995 version have been introduced by JCGM/WG 1. These corrections occur in subclauses 4.2.2, 4.2.4, 5.1.2, B.2.17, C.3.2, C.3.4, E.4.3, H.4.3, H.5.2.5 and H.6.2.</p>

<p id="_54674537-056d-5f0d-2d20-5dae79f13601">Almost all believed that it was important to arrive at an internationally accepted procedure for expressing measurement uncertainty and for combining individual uncertainty components into a single total uncertainty. However, a consensus was not apparent on the method to be used. The BIPM then convened a meeting for the purpose of arriving at a uniform and generally acceptable procedure for the specification of uncertainty; it was attended by experts from 11 national standards laboratories. This Working Group on the Statement of Uncertainties<index><primary>Working Group on the Statement of Uncertainties</primary></index> developed Recommendation INC-1 (1980<index><primary>Recommendation INC-1 (1980</primary></index>), Expression of Experimental Uncertainties <eref type="inline" bibitemid="KAARLS1981" citeas="[2]"/>.

<p id="_c6b0dc16-6e8a-4927-2b65-2475d58f24d5">The task of developing a detailed guide based on the Working Group Recommendation (which is a brief outline rather than a detailed prescription) was referred by the CIPM to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), since ISO could better reflect the needs arising from the broad interests of industry and commerce.</p>

<p id="_6caf62ff-c23b-9e7b-dd03-1259463139c6">Responsibility was assigned to the ISO Technical Advisory Group on Metrology (TAG 4) because one of its tasks is to coordinate the development of guidelines on measurement topics that are of common interest to ISO and the six organizations that participate with ISO in the work of TAG 4: the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the partner of ISO in worldwide standardization; the CIPM and the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML), the two worldwide metrology organizations; the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the two international unions that represent chemistry and physics; and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC).<index><primary>IUPAC</primary></index><index><primary>IUPAP</primary></index><index><primary>IEC</primary></index><index><primary>IFCC</primary></index><index><primary>ISO</primary></index><index><primary>ISO/TAG 4</primary></index><index><primary>OIML</primary></index></p>

An important example is the use of calibration designs, often based on the method of least squares, to evaluate the uncertainties arising from both short- and long-term random variations in the results of comparisons of material artefacts of unknown values, such as gauge blocks and standards of mass, with reference standards of known values. In such comparatively simple measurement situations, components of uncertainty can frequently be evaluated by the statistical analysis of data obtained from designs consisting of nested sequences of measurements of the measurand for a number of different values of the quantities upon which it depends — a so-called analysis of variance (see <xref target="scls_H-5"/>).<index><primary>ANOVA</primary></index><index><primary>Type A evaluation of uncertainty</primary></index><index><primary>uncertainty</primary><secondary>statistical evaluation of</secondary><tertiary>by varying input quantities</tertiary></index><note id="_95f03a43-248a-e6b2-d525-97120af42c41"><p id="_7303b94e-fc87-50dd-3d92-969e0dca4b5a">At lower levels of the calibration chain<index><primary>calibration chain</primary></index>, where reference standards are often assumed to be exactly known because they have been calibrated by a national or primary standards laboratory, the uncertainty of a calibration result may be a single Type A standard uncertainty evaluated from the pooled experimental standard deviation that characterizes the measurement.<index><primary>unit</primary><secondary>use of an adopted value of a measurement standard as a</secondary></index><index><primary>variance</primary><secondary>pooled estimate of (or pooled experimental standard deviation)</secondary></index></p>
