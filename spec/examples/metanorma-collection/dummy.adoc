.Foreword

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of
preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical
committee has been established has the right to be represented on that
committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in
liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the
different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents
should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial
rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

== Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a framework for the establishment,
implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an anger management system. This
standard outlines the requirements for effectively managing personal and group
anger in various settings, including workplaces, schools, and community
organizations.

Anger is a natural emotion, but when it is not managed properly, it can lead to
negative outcomes, including personal distress and interpersonal conflict. This
standard aims to provide guidance on how to manage anger constructively.

== Scope

This document specifies requirements for an anger management system to enable an
organization or individual to establish, implement, maintain, and improve
policies, procedures, and practices for the management of anger. It is
applicable to any organization or individual, regardless of type or size, and
can be adapted to various cultural, social, and legal contexts.
